This is a Flask application running in AWS Lambda using [Zappa](https://github.com/zappa/Zappa). The purpose of this app is to listen for messages sent by UNDL in response to record submissions via their submission API. When records are submitted via their submission API, an initial HTTP response is received immediately to confirm they received the API submission request. The records then enter a queue in their system, waiting to be processed and fully imported. When the record has been fully processed by their system, another message is sent this app. We then log the information that was sent back.
